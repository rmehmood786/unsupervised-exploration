# Unsupervised Learning: Research-Style Project


## What’s inside
- **Modular library (`src/unsup/`)** for embeddings (PCA, t‑SNE, UMAP), clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative, GMM), evaluation, and visualization.
- **Reproducible scripts** for running experiments and saving metrics/figures.
- **Unit tests** to show engineering discipline.
- **Makefile** with common tasks; `pyproject.toml` for packaging; **MIT license**.

  (The codebase supports many unsupervised methods to try and play.)

## Quickstart
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
make install
make run  # runs Iris with PCA+KMeans and saves outputs/ and metrics
```

Or run a custom experiment:
```bash
python scripts/run_experiment.py --dataset wine --embed umap --cluster gmm --n-clusters 3 --outdir outputs/wine_umap_gmm
```

## Results & Reproducibility
Running `make run` produces:
- a 2D scatter plot of the embedded data colored by cluster labels (under `outputs/`), and
- a `metrics.json` with internal and external clustering scores (silhouette, Calinski–Harabasz, Davies–Bouldin; ARI, NMI, homogeneity/completeness/V-measure when ground truth is available).

## How can you extend this to learn more on unsupervised learning. 
- **Modeling**: add spectral clustering, HDBSCAN, or deep embeddings (e.g., autoencoders).
- **Evaluation**: include stability (bootstrap) and robustness to noise; clusterability metrics (e.g., Hopkins statistic).
- **Experimentation**: manage sweeps via YAML in `experiments/configs/` and a loop in `scripts/run_experiment.py`.
- **Reporting**: create a polished notebook in `notebooks/` that imports `unsup` and regenerates figures for a paper-style report.
- **Software craft**: add CI (GitHub Actions), pre-commit hooks, and docstrings with `pdoc` or `sphinx`.
